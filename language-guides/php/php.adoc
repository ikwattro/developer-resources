=== Neo4j for PHP Developers

image::{img}php_logo.png[float=right,width=300]

You're a PHP developer and want to start with Neo4j?
Here you go.

Whether you're using frameworks like Symfony and Laravel or you're developing without frameworks, you'll find an adequate library for your use case.

// end::intro[]

If you have any questions, you can always find a community member around on Twitter or StackOverflow by tagging your subjects with #neo4j-php.


Members of the PHP community have invested a lot of time and love to develop all these drivers, so please if you use them, provide feedback to the authors.

=== Using Neo4j in a standalone PHP environment

If you prefer to develop without frameworks, these libraries are made for you:

////
The BOLT driver itself is located at https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-bolt-php

I don’t expect a lot of people to use directly this repository, but they can if they want to use bolt only

The Client is located at https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-php-client and embraces the bolt driver and the http driver. Both Bolt and http use the API defined in the TCK, so if they want to switch from http to bolt and vice versa it is just a change in the url.

Concerning documentation, currently I have only the README.

    echo sprintf('Person name is : %s and has %d number of friends', $record->value('name'), count($record->value('friends'));

==== neo4j-pdo


This is a PHP Data Objects driver for the Neo4j graph database, it allows you to connect to a Neo4j server from PHP using the standard PDO API.
The project currently only implements a “vanilla” PHP implementation, which means you need to use a special constructor to create your PDO connection.
PHP extensions to register the driver with PDO in HHVM and Zend VM are planned future work.
